Ph.D.
------
I'm working on topics related to Data Management in a single data center and geographically distributed clouds environments.

As a member of [DISCOVERY Initiative](http://beyondtheclouds.github.io), the first part of my Ph.D. was dedicated for improving service provisioning in geo-distributed clouds and Fog/Edge environments. We worked on network-aware retrieval of Virtual Machine Images in geo-distributed clouds and on the network-aware placement of container images in Edge environment (for more details, our work led to two publications [here](publication/darrous-ccgrid18) and [here](publication/darrous-icccn19)).

Currently, I'm focusing on reducing the storage cost of data intensive clusters. More specifically, we study the opportunities and the challenges in integrating *erasure coding* for online data analytics.
<!-- Currently, I'm in my 2<sup>nd</sup> year of Ph.D. During the first year, I was working on Virtual Machine Image management in geo-distributed data centers. The work results in a system prototype [Nitro](publication/darrous-ccgrid18) with a paper published in [CCGrid'18](https://ccgrid2018.seas.gwu.edu). -->

<!-- **Keyword**: Data management, Geo-distributed Clouds, Wide-Area Networks, Distributes storage systems, Virtual Machine Images. -->

I'm a member of [avalon team](http://avalon.ens-lyon.fr) of [inria research center](http://inria.fr) that is hosted in [LIP](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/) laboratory, located at [ENS de Lyon](http://ens-lyon.fr).

### People
During my Ph.D., I'm working closely with my two advisors: [Shadi Ibrahim](http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Shadi.Ibrahim/) and [Christian Perez](http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/~cperez/web/doku.php).

### Research Project
I'm part of [DISCOVERY Initiative](http://beyondtheclouds.github.io), a research project that explores the methodologies and algorithms needed to deploy and operate massively distributed cloud infrastructure as Fog/Edge environments. Developed prototypes and tools are ported to OpenStack, an open source de-facto IaaS manager.
