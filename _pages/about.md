Ph.D. Topic
------
I’m working on Data Management in a geo-distributed cloud environment. Currently, I'm in my 2<sup>nd</sup> year of Ph.D. During the first year, I was working on Virtual Machine Image management in geo-distributed data centers. The work results in a system prototype [Nitro](publication/darrous-ccgrid18) with a paper published in [CCGrid'18](https://ccgrid2018.seas.gwu.edu).

**Keyword**: Data management, Geo-distributed Clouds, Wide-Area Networks, Distributes storage systems, Virtual Machine Images.

I'm a member of [avalon team](http://avalon.ens-lyon.fr) of [inria research center](http://inria.fr) that is hosted in [LIP](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/) laboratory, located at [ENS de Lyon](http://ens-lyon.fr).

People
------
During my Ph.D., I'm working closely with my two advisors: [Shadi Ibrahim](http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Shadi.Ibrahim/) and [Christian Perez](http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/~cperez/web/doku.php).

Research Project
------
I’m part of [DISCOVERY Initiative](http://beyondtheclouds.github.io), a research project that explores the methodologies and algorithms needed to deploy and operate massively distributed cloud infrastructure as Fog/Edge environments. Developed prototypes and tools are ported to OpenStack, an open source de-facto IaaS manager.
