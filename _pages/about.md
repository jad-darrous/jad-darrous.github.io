Research team
------
I'm a member of [Avalon](http://avalon.ens-lyon.fr) and [Stack](http://stack.inria.fr) teams of [inria research center](http://inria.fr) that are hosted in [LIP](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/) and [LS2N](https://www.ls2n.fr) laboratories, respectively.
I'm registered at the university (i.e., Ã©cole) [ENS de Lyon](http://ens-lyon.fr) for the Ph.D. degree.
During my Ph.D., I'm working closely with my two advisors: [Shadi Ibrahim](http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Shadi.Ibrahim/) and [Christian Perez](http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/~cperez/web/doku.php).


Ph.D. Topic
------
I'm working on topics related to Data Management in a single data center and geographically distributed clouds environments.

<!-- As a member of [DISCOVERY Initiative](http://beyondtheclouds.github.io),  -->
The first part of my Ph.D. was dedicated for improving service provisioning in geo-distributed clouds and Fog/Edge environments. We worked on network-aware retrieval of Virtual Machine Images in geo-distributed clouds and on the network-aware placement of container images in Edge environment (for more details, our work led to two publications [here](publications/darrous-ccgrid18) and [here](publications/darrous-icccn19)).

Currently, I'm focusing on reducing the storage cost of data intensive clusters. More specifically, we study the opportunities and the challenges in integrating *erasure coding* for online data analytics. As a first step, through an in-depth performance evaluation study we evaluate how analytic workloads, data persistency, failures, the back-end storage devices, and the network configuration impact the performance for MapReduce jobs running under erasure coding and replication (this work led to a publication [here](publications/darrous-mascots19)). Moreover, a poster about data processing in Fog can be found [here](posters/darrous-icpp19).

<!-- **Keyword**: Data management, Geo-distributed Clouds, Wide-Area Networks, Distributes storage systems, Virtual Machine Images. -->

Briefly, The subject of this thesis is a scalable and efficient data management for building and running data intensive services.

Research Project
------
I'm part of [DISCOVERY Initiative](http://beyondtheclouds.github.io), a research project that explores the methodologies and algorithms needed to deploy and operate massively distributed cloud infrastructure as Fog/Edge environments. Developed prototypes and tools are ported to OpenStack, an open source de-facto IaaS manager.


Papers reviews
------
I reviewed papers as subreviewer for ICPP 2019, SmartData 2019, HPBDC 2019, Cluster 2017, CCGRID 2017 and CloudCom 2017.
