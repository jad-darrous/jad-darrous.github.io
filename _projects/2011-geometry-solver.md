**Description:** Designed as an *Expert System*, the system solves simple geometry problems as difficult as secondary school geometry. The software has a simple GUI for drawing the sketch and then uses an inference mechanism to compute the remaining unknowns along with printing the applied steps. Later on, we extend the project and submit it to an innovation contest [Fikra Competition](http://www.ti-scs.org/news/view.php?id=20#mainTd) and we won the 3<sup>rd</sup> place.

**Technologies and languages:** Java with JESS (Java Expert System Shell) library.

**Man power:** 3 students for 4 months.

**Final note:** 95/100
